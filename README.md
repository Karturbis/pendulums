Pendulums is a program to get a feeling for pendulums and oblique throws.
First the player has to enter the starting angle of the thread pendulum,
then the player has to release the pendulum weight at the right moment
to hit the target.
One of the aims of this program is to simulate the pendulum movement and the
oblique throw as realistically as possible.


Code from pygame (https://github.com/pygame/pygame) is used.
The random module from python is used.
