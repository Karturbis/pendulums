Pendulums is a program to get a feeling for the physics of pendulums and oblique throws.
The player has to release the pendulum weight at the right moment to hit the target.
One of the aims of this program is to simulate the pendulum movement and the
oblique throw as realistically as possible. Although it is to note that
this is a simple model, where there is for example no air.


Code from pygame (https://github.com/pygame/pygame) is used.
The random module from python is used.
